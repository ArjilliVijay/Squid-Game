# Squid-Game
🦑 Project Title: Squid Game - Interactive Website 💻 Project Overview: I have designed and developed a Squid Game-themed responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspired by the globally popular Netflix series Squid Game, this website reflects the show's intense atmosphere, vibrant styling, and dark competitive energy.

The site is visually rich and interactive, combining cinematic imagery, embedded videos, an interactive image gallery, a QR-code feature for easy access, and a working contact form — all styled to match the iconic Squid Game aesthetic.

🔧 Technologies Used: HTML5 for structured layout and semantic sections

CSS3 for styling, responsive layout, animations, and hover effects

JavaScript for interactivity (scroll to sections, gallery slider, form enhancements)

Formspree (or similar) for the contact form handling

YouTube Embed for official trailers

QR Code to provide quick mobile access to game or app

🧩 Key Features Implemented: 🟢 1. Fixed Navigation Bar with Iconic Image Links: Navbar built using image icons (Home, About, Gallery, Contact) instead of text

Smooth scroll behavior using anchor tags (#sectionID)

Hover animations that show an underline effect below images

Fully responsive: Navbar adapts to smaller screens using media queries

🟢 2. Welcome Section (Hero Section): Two powerful Squid Game images placed side-by-side

"Start Game" button with image inside, when clicked scrolls to About section

Styled using flexbox and responsive for mobile view

🟢 3. Embedded Video Section: Integrated a YouTube trailer using <iframe>

Responsive using CSS aspect ratio tricks to fit all screen sizes

Positioned below the welcome section to enhance user engagement

🟢 4. About Section (Game Challenge): Descriptive paragraphs about Squid Game Season 3 Play Along Challenge

Listed features like unlocking characters, multiplayer rewards, and updates

Styled with game-themed fonts and colors

QR-code image included to encourage scanning and downloading the game/app

🟢 5. Interactive Image Gallery: Users can browse through in-game screenshots using animated left and right arrows

JavaScript used to manage image transitions dynamically

Gallery is mobile responsive and works with swipe-style navigation

🟢 6. Gameplay Info Section: Brief introduction to game mechanics and style

Emphasis on battle royale survival, teamwork, and Squid Game-inspired challenges

Netflix branding and themed assets displayed to enhance authenticity

🟢 7. Contact Section: Built using a fully functional HTML contact form

Fields: Name, Email, Subject, and Message

Submits data via Formspree.io

Layout adjusted for both desktop and mobile views

Includes character image and Squid Game-themed decorations

🟢 8. Footer Section: Includes horizontal separator and Squid Game-styled closing text

“Made by” credit, year, and Netflix-style legal footer

📱 Mobile Responsiveness: I implemented media queries to make the entire website fully responsive:

Navbar transforms into stacked layout on smaller screens

Images and buttons resize properly

Text aligns and scales based on screen width

Gallery and contact form are touch-friendly

🎨 Design Approach: Used dark background with neon pink, red, and white — matching the show’s visual identity

Circular, triangular, and square iconography where appropriate

Flexbox and CSS grid used for layout management

Hover and transition effects used to improve user experience.
